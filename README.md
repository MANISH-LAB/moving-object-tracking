# moving-object-tracking
 An object monitoring system that uses the histogram backprojection of the object (region of interest) over the frames of a video for identification 
 and CAMShift algorithm for tracking its movement. Lighting conditions are handled by use HUE channel of the HSV images (frames) and 
 CAMShift takes care of moving objects distance and angle WRT the camera.
